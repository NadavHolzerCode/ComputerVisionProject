# ComputerVisionProject
In this project, we utilized DeepMind's TAPIR model to analyze videos of Parkinson's patients walking through a corridor while wearing eye-tracking glasses. Our goal was to map the patients' gaze positions onto a single heatmap.

Using TAPIR, we tracked any point on the screen with high accuracy. Leveraging computer vision tools, we processed the gaze data and successfully generated a comprehensive heatmap, providing valuable insights into the patients' visual attention patterns.
